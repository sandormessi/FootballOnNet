The server proccesses the messages as packets.
A packet contains a PacketHeader:
	- Command (the type of command)
	- SizeOfPacket (the size of data will be sent)
	- MessageType (how the packet's data should be processed)
And a "body" as a Stream

The messages are XML-messages, except when the data is a simple type, like Integer.
The size of Pitch, the time of Match, the Scores (goals) are determined by the Server.
The Client just moves the ball and the players. The Server acts as a mediator and the Referre as well.
The connection's state is not "stored" --> if the connection is lost then it cannot be recovered.

The initial messages must be sent in the correct order!

Messages from the server's perspective:
	- Client sends the Team
	- Client query the Pitch (its size)
	- Process the client's Position Collection continuously
	- Process the client's positon of the Ball continuously
	- The server send a Match Result at the end of the match

Messages from the client's perspective:
	- Sends it's Team
	- Query the Pitch
	- Process the Overall Match Data continously
	- Send the Position Collection continuously (players and the ball)
	- Process the Match Result at the end of Match
